#Ancient Dwarven

The lost dwarven civilization of Esperan were masters of technology. They forged intricate armors and weapons, built constructs and golems to defend their homes, cut deep roads and cities throughout the region, until a dwarf could walk a hundred miles without ever emerging above ground.

They built machines to harvest their crops, grind their grain, and smelt the ore from their mines, all so cleverly designed that a child, at the pull of a lever, could carry out these tasks.

They constructed great cannons, that made the task of downing a great dragon as simple as dispatching a cow at the slaughterhouse.

But none of these were their greatest work.

The greatest creation of theirs was The Loom.

Connected to strange machinery, with gears that faded to allow a pendulum to pass before reappearing, and with wheels that did not quite fit into the space they seemed to occupy,  The Loom was small in size, with room for only a single dwarf to fit in front of it. A series of slots allowed metal plates with precise holes to be slotted in, changing the patterns that the rails above made.

No visible thread ran through this construction, but the levers and bars clearly pushed against something that couldn't quite be comprehended.

A short adjustment of The Loom, and an army that had set out on a two hundred mile march would arrive at their destination an hour later, well rested, having pleasantly strolled along the intervening distance.

Another setting, and the wheat planted this morning would be golden and ready to harvest by the afternoon. Another, and the whiskey bottled last week would already be aged perfectly. Other settings could trap enemies, freezing them in time until a suitable force could arrive, or slowing time for them, so that they could only fire one bolt for every seven fired by the dwarves.

For hundreds of years, the Loom brought peace to Esperan. It was capable of destroying any army attempting to invade the kingdom, but incapable of affecting time outside the borders. The dwarves could not be attacked, and could provide for all of their wants. Peace, until the breaking, reigned over the kingdom.

History does not accurately record what caused the Loom to shatter, but the results were catastrophic. The entire of Esperan dropped out of time, vanishing completely for two hundred years. Those towards the edge of the kingdom continued to live normal lives, trapped from escaping, but continuing with their skirmishes and battles as before. Those close to the Loom were not so fortunate. 

Near the Loom, time ran at all speeds. A squad of dwarven legionaries aged hundreds of years, before finally crumbling into dust. Another squad was frozen in time, watching trees explode out of the ground and crumble into nothing before they could speak a sentence. Magic, too, turned against them. Wands and staves exploded in their users' hands. Runes to create sunlight opened burning rifts, through which formless beings of fire poured. Enchanted axes, driven mad, forced their owners on to slaughter their comrades, until they collapsed from exhaustion.

Tunnels fell, as tree roots and erosion caused the rock to crumble in mere minutes.
