# Northspur Trading Company

The Northspur Trading Company is a large, privately owned organization, dedicated to the pursuit of profit for its owners. With an army to rival several mid sized nations, a ruthless head for business, and a willingness to deal harshly with those that get in the way of its enterprises, Northspur is a force to be reckoned with in the surrounding region.

Northspur is willing to employ large numbers of adventurers to do its dirty work, pays well, and is willing to turn a blind eye to any questionable methods used to get the job done.

## Sites:
### Luden (Capital)
Luden is a garrison and port city, run by Northspur. The city is split into two sections. The organized, planned section, taken up by the garrison, officers and town leaders is next to the coast, and surrounded by a fort wall. Outside the walls, there is a giant shanty town, known as The Shambles, separated by main roads running from the fort, and surrounded by a rough wooden pallisade. Luden has an extremely vigorous black market trade in dwarven artifacts, and several organized crime elements have sprung up as a response. Recent conflicts between the garrison and the locals led to a floating siege platform being positioned above the fort.


### Fort Resolute
A medium sized, well equipped frontier fort. Newly constructed from earth banks, and well equipped, it acts as a starting point for convoys to Luden, taking resources from the interior to the coast. The fort contains a garrison, and a small number of traders, along with a purchaser from Northspur, who is happy to buy dwarven artifacts, and may have the occasional special request.
