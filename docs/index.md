#Esperan

The farming town of Esperan, nestled deep in the valley of the Riu Inreve, has always prided itself on its simple, peaceful way of life. It came as quite a shock to them then, when vast tracts of wilderness appeared just downstream of the valley. It also came as a shock when the Pathfinder Society moved into town, searching for adventure and the ruins of a lost Dwarven empire. Of course, the Pathfinders aren’t the only group looking to exploit these lands, The Northspur Trade Company and local orcs are also racing to unravel the mysteries of this new frontier, and rumours abound of strange humanoids making their way up from beneath the ground. Whatever your reasons for wanting to explore these new lands, you have signed on with the Pathfinders, and taken your first steps into the unknown. Welcome to Esperan, may you find friendship, riches and always a good story to tell.




##What is Esperan?

Esperan is a player driven, West Marches style role-playing campaign for Pathfinder 1st Edition.
There's no set party, no set game night, players join together on their own terms to explore and pursue goals that interest them within a shared world. Want to slay that dragon? Delve into those Dwarven ruins? Gather up a group, find a GM and go hunting!

##What is a West Marches game?:

A West Marches game has a few key differences from a regular RPG campaign:

There’s no set Party (it’s up to players to organise groups to go out each session), no set game night (again, up to players and GMs to organise), no set story to follow (players decide what they want to do in advance of each session, though you may end up following a set of related adventures).

Every game session begins and ends In the town of Esperan. Session reports are always shared, you live in the same town, word gets around.

It's a living world, so no two parties can follow the same rumour, once the dragon is slain, someone else can’t slay it (without necromancy being involved).

The map the players see is up to the players to build, it is only as accurate and complete as the players make it (GMs will not correct the map).

The world doesn’t always level with the players, while zones closer to Esperan are usually safer, sometimes you may have to retreat and try again when you’re a little more experienced. Don’t worry, if you’re quick, you may well get your vengeance one day.


If you have any questions, check the FAQ or ask in the Help channel. Good luck out there adventurer.

##How Do I Get Started?

Well, if you’re here you’ve probably already joined our discord at: https://discord.gg/bvPFZX6 If not, what’re you waiting for? From there, ask a GM to add you to the Roll20 table, and help you make a 1st level pathfinder society legal character (if you’re not sure if something’s legal, check here https://www.aonprd.com/ or check the guidelines channel in the discord). If you need help building your character, ask a GM or discuss it in the character builds channel. Once your character’s made and a GM’s approved it, you’re good to go, drop into the “looking for players” channel and sign up with a group.

Important note: All characters will be provided with a “Waystone” at character creation.


##Waystone
'''Aura: moderate conjuration     Weight:-     Slot: -        Price: 16,400gp    CL: 13'''
Description
This small quartz pendant is attuned to a magical beacon housed in the old dwarven barrow in Esperan. Once per day, by concentrating on the pendant for 10 uninterrupted minutes, the user may cast Greater Teleport (as the spell) targeting only the beacon site in Esperan. A Pathfinder who sells their Waystone will not be provided with a new one, causing them to be unable to adventure.

##What should my character be like?

All characters have been employed by the Pathfinders to go out, map out new lands, and solve problems for good and profit.

Your character should have a reason to have joined the Pathfinders originally

The Pathfinders have recently begun advertising internally the opportunity for discovery that is the Valley beyond Esperan. The lands have incredibly weird magical properties that are visible, strange and dangerous.
If your character was not part of the Pathfinders initially, but would like to have heard about the phenomena or the quest to the ancient lands beyond. You may find an appropriate justification to have heard that the Pathfinders are involved in the discovery of the new lands.

To dive on the opportunity now is an act of the passionate:

You need a goal or reason to go out of the way to a mysterious land with strange magical phenomena where ancient cultures once resided



##Tell me about the Pathfinders

The Pathfinders take a very hands off approach with their agents. Members are free to pursue their own leads and choose their own priorities. These members explore, delve, and otherwise experience the lesser-seen parts of the world. They compile these findings and share them across the group to better their understanding of the world.

In return for their findings, members are given a free place to rest and eat, access to a vast repository of knowledge, and a platform to share their findings should they wish to do so.

To join the Pathfinders there is a basic physical fitness test. As well as a morality test. If you are a caster, you can do a few additional tests, that can counteract poor scores in the physical assignment.

In Esperan, the Pathfinders are operating out of the Way's End Inn, which has enough beds for the officials and first wave of adventurers. Back in the rest of the world they occupy large buildings like lodges to house and hold official business.

##Okay, I have a character, how do I find plots of my own to follow?

In Esperan, adventurers follow Rumours to lead them to their goals. Rumours are usually obtained in play, if something takes your character’s interest, a GM will let you claim it as a rumour. Your wizard notices a strange magical light in the sky, maybe you want to investigate? Smoke billows out of a mountain to the North, what could be causing it?

Most Rumours are fair game for anyone to follow, as long as they’re not bound to a particular character/object. As such, they should be reported with session reports, and added to the Rumour Pool. If you want to follow a rumour from the pool, post about it in the looking-for-players channel, and drum up some support to follow it. From time to time GMs may add extra rumours to the pool as well.


##Karma
 Players may be awarded Karma for particular out of character actions, such as submitting session reports, character/world art, making significant lore contributions and taking novel actions to make the campaign a better/more welcoming place (eg. helping new players with characters).
Once per scene, before a d20 roll is made, a player may spend one Karma to roll two d20s and take the better result.
