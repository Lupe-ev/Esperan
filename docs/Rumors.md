## Current Rumors

### Supplies and Demands
*Global rumour*  
Some merchants have been arriving in Esperan. But they look tired and haggard. Apparently they were attacked by brigands but a few miles outside the town, and it is making them nervous. And how will you get supplies if merchants don't want to travel here…  

### Something wicked this way comes
*Global rumour*  
A lookout drags an old woman into town, who is ranting and raving, covered in dirt  and bruises, and wearing the most bizarre clothes. Lookout says she walked in from the wilds, and she has been ranting at him for half an hour. She says only complete nonsense like "the metal cans, sturdy on two legs, a hundred years and a day" and "they are short of being human, but not human for being short, hahahahhaha!" and many other weird and whacky things. But there are moments of sanity, and you can't help but feel there is more here than an old crazy…  

### Set in Stone
*Given to: Rinir Fireblood*   
While searching for lost scouts, a group of pathfinders stumbled upon a large statue of an Orc hewn from grey granite. The Figure is stood on a sideways hourglass, wielding an axe, around its base, an inscription in Orcish reads: “Aefried Vistlic stopped the world here, by his sacrifice we live, and one day will rejoin the world”. Supposedly someone is tending to the shrine, but who could live in such an inhospitable place?  

### A Raw Deal
*Given to: Griblex*  
There are goblins out to the north of Esperan. They aren’t exactly trusting, but an ally is an ally on the edge of the world, and this really is the edge of the world. A provisional deal has been agreed, but there are going to be issues on both sides to resolve before you see the benefits

### Better Red than Dead
*Given to: Jax Kolby*  
A vast pillar of red light has been found to the east. Pathfinder scouts who went into the area were found dead not 100 foot from it, withered to old age. Local Ratfolk say fawns go into the light and come out fully grown in minutes. Perhaps it would be worth investigating what causes this strange phenomenon.


### A mitey fine mess
*Global Rumour*  
Mites are small fey creatures, and not the fun kind. A group of them reportedly murdered some of ours, time for some payback!

## Completed
### Tying up Loose ends- (Completed)
*Global Rumour: Lvl 1*  
Pathfinder Society Scouts were sent out to explore the new lands to the East. They never returned. The Chapter Master is looking for a group of brave souls to find out what happened to them and hopefully bring them home. Be careful out there, we don’t want to send another rescue mission.

### What is all this horsing around?- (Completed)
*Global rumour: Lvl 1*  
Recently there have been some strange things happening around Esperan: weird scratches on the walls, teeth marks on fences, and Rosa Coeur De Fer's dog was beaten up. Last night the stable caught fire, and some figures were seen running away...
